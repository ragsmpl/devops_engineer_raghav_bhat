# Raghav Bhat - Netapp

**Patch release engineer**
I joined storage domain company - Netapp. I was part of EPS team which handles customer specific issues. Any customer specific issue used to be a high priority one and we had to provide the patch delivery on time. 

I learnt collaboration and communication as part of my job. When we get a request for a patch release, I had to get in touch with the development director for that product and get the approval for the patch release. Once it is given, I had to contact the developer and get is workspace details from perforce which contained the fix. 

Take the latest stable version of the software on which customer is currently on and apply the fix for the bug and build the same. 
Initially we did not have Jenkins setup, we used to create screen for each build and monitor the same. 

Once build is done, fire the testing. Built software installed on the testbed and basic smoke tests would be completed. Once I get the smoke test results, I would send the build to the QA team for more testing. 

This whole process needs multiple followups and every patch release has the SLA which had to be met. 

Once I get the test results, I used to prepare the README file manually for the patch release with the details of the fix and push to the delivery channel and make it available for field engineer to download.

Then collect all the patch releases made and target them for the main release. 

After spending few months and understanding the system better, I proposed need for automation in most of the steps we were performing. I introduced Jenkins and shell scripts as part of the system. There was separate job to build, test, prepare the README files. This introduction of automation avoided all the human errors and process had better traceability.
