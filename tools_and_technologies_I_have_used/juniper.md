# Raghav Bhat - Juniper

**DevOps engineer**
In Juniper I learnt the art of DevOps engineering. I was hired as a DevOps engineer who is responsible for maintaining continuous integration system.

There was a tools team who were responsible for developing CI CD system and there was a build team responsible for designing build systems. I used to be the bridge between tools team, build team and developers. 

It was the network related software and it was using cmake tool to build. CI CD system was designed using Jenkins and SVN. 

Any issue with respect to operation of the CI CD used to be my responsibility. Analyse the issue with the patches, build failures, test failures, conflict issues, managing gating for each branch my day to day work. 
Gradually when I understood the system, I started giving ideas to improve the system. As the ideas started helping developer community, I was recognized and inducted into architecture team. 

I used to involved in architectural discussions related to the the system. It gave me opportunity to contribute to the big scale continuous integration and continuous deployment.
