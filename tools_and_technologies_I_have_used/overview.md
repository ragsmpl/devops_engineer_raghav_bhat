# Raghav Bhat - DevOps Architect/Release manager!

Hi! I'm Raghavendra Bhat. I am a E&C graduate from Manipal Institute of technology [2011 Batch]. I have around 10 years of experienced build/release/DevOps engineer. 
I am writing this to explain what I have done in last 10 years, my journey, my learning curve, my achievements, challenges I have faced and how I did overcome them. I have used many tools and technologies. It will be difficult to cover all the use cases in the CV or in the interview. Hence I have created this folder with all the uses cases for each tools and technologies that I have used.
